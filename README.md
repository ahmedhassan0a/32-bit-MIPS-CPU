# 32-bit-MIPS-CPU
this is 32-bit MIPS style processor, it was designed using [logisim-evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution) according to the requirments specified in [Project_Spring_2025_Final.pdf](https://github.com/ahmedhassan0a/32-bit-MIPS-CPU/blob/main/Project_%20Spring_2025_Final.pdf) and it was done on two phases.

### phase1: design a Single sycle processor.
